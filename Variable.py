# We check in a patient name John Smith. He's 20 years old and is a new patient.
# Define 3 variable "name, age and if he is a new patient."

Full_name = "John Smith"
Age = 20
is_new_patient = False

print(Full_name)
print(Age)

if is_new_patient:
    print("Yes new patient.")

else:
    print("No new patient.")

# In this exercise I only had to give variable and not print anything.
